The Prism.Avalonia package is a fast and modern MVVM library which provides Navigation, Regions, Modularity, Eventing, and more, all powered by DryIoc.

Born out of the Microsoft Patterns and Practices, Prism Library turbo-charges your development efforts.

This package can be used on nearly any app platform: Avalonia, Maui, WPF, Xamarin, Uno, and more; and on any runtime: .NET Native, .NET Core, .NET Framework, or Mono. The API surface is identical in all cases, making it perfect for building shared libraries.

The package contains a collection of standard, self-contained, lightweight types that provide a starting implementation for building modern apps using the MVVM pattern. These types alone are usually enough for many users to build apps without needing additional external references.

This package aims to offer flexibility over which components to use. All types are loosely-coupled, so that it's only necessary to include what you use. There is no requirement to go "all-in" with a specific series of all-encompassing APIs, nor is there a set of mandatory patterns that need to be followed when building apps using these helpers. Combine these building blocks in a way that best fits your needs.
